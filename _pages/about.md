*** ADD STH HERE ! ***


Hello!

    I'm a PhD student in Management Science & Engineering at Stanford, working with [Prof. Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/). Previously, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at University of Toronto, and did my undergrad in Computer Engineering at Sharif University.

<h3>My Research</h3>
    I'm interested in using machine learning to tackle constrained optimization problems. Right now I'm working on methods that leverage graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to solve contrained optimization problems on graphs.

<h4> That was a bunch of fancy terms, but what does it mean exactly? </h4>

    Graph-structured data is abundant around us, and we've been modeling and solving real-world problems with graphs for decades. We've already developed optimal and fast solutions to a subset of these problems. However, some others are too hard, complicated, or time-consuming to solve using explicit mathematical and algorithmic methods (NP problems are a good example).

    Neural networks are good at extracting complicated patterns from high-dimensional data. We can use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to embed the graphical information into numerical representations, feed those to an RL model, and ask the model to generate a solution by maximizing/minimizing an objective of interest. 

<h4>It sounds cool! Is it of any use?</h4>

    This approach is scalable and can result in close to optimal results. It, however, is not fully interpretable and lacks optimality guarantees. The pros and cons make it a perfect fit for a subgroup of graph optimization problems, but not for all of them. Proper modeling of the input information, expressive architecture design, and problem-specific constraint enforcement are some of the challenges of this approach. Making all of the modules work together can also be tricky.

Some examples of real-world applications are:
* Supply Chain Management
* Grid Optimization
* Social Media Marketing
* Circuit Design
* Network Optimization 

<h4>I need to maximize/minimize something on a graph. Can we talk?</h4>

Of course! Feel free to shoot me an email at [teshnizi@stanford.edu](mailto:teshnizi@stanford.edu). I'd also love to chat about anything else that you find related and interesting!
